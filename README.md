## üåü What Makes This Project Stand Out

- **Performance Focused** - Optimized loading with Next.js App Router and multi-layer caching
- **Cloud Native** - Leverages AWS services for scalable, reliable infrastructure
- **Type Safety** - End-to-end TypeScript implementation for robust code
- **Real-time Features** - Socket.io integration for instant messaging and notifications
- **Secure Authentication** - HTTP-only cookie auth pattern with JWT
